# About the challenge
about:
  title: "The Challenge"
  desc: "PPAI4SDG will gather 12 teams from around the world to engage in a challenge using open spending data, development indicators, and the Policy Priority Inference (PPI) framework.
  The organisers would like to invite anyone interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence, open government data, and computational social science.
  The event will count with a fantastic panel of research and policy experts who will evaluate the different policy-prioritisation strategies developed by the participating teams.
  The winning team will be awarded a trip to London to visit The Alan Turing Institute and to attend its annual conference AIUK in March 2024."

  size_desc: "Anyone registered can attend both the opening and closing events. However, a maximum of 12 teams will be able to take part of the data challenge."

  selection_title: "Team selection criteria"
  selection_desc: "We are seeking for a diverse pool of teams who would benefit in different ways from taking part of the data challenge.
  Some of the potential participants may include consultants at international organisations conducting feasibility studies, 
  analysts interested in evaluating governments at NGOs, civil servants involved in budgeting and planning, 
  and researchers and graduate students performing impact evaluation among others. When selecting the participating teams, 
  we will be paying special attention to the following criteria: "

  selection_1: "The professional background and diversity of the team members"
  selection_2: "Their motivation to take part of the data challenge"
  selection_3: "The potential benefits that PPAI4SDG could to the team members and their organisations"

  rules_title: "Rules"
  rules_desc: "The challengers will be given a case study along with data on government expenditure and development indicators across the Sustainable Development Goals. 
  They will be tasked with advising the government in terms of policy prioritisation strategies to achieve the SDGs. 
  Such strategies may build on a diverse set of analyses such as benchmarking, gapping, feasibility assessment, bottleneck detection, accelerator discovery, impact evaluation, etc. 
  The participating teams will employ the Policy Priority Inference online application to conduct such analyses and to justify the advised prioritisation strategy. 
  Each team will submit an anonymised report on Friday 2 February 2024, which will be evaluated by the expert panellists. 
  The winner will be announced during the closing event on 9 February 2024."

# About PPI
about_ppi:
  title: "About Policy Priority Inference (PPI)"
  desc: "PPI is a research programme aims at modelling the causal link between government expenditure and policy outcomes while accounting for 
  the multidimensionality and complexity of development. 
  It employs computational methods to overcome the limitations of coarse-grained data on development indicators and public spending."
  desc_2: "PPI has developed as a collaboration between The Alan Turing Institute (London), the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económica (Mexico City), 
  and the United Nations Development Programme.
  Its tools have supported development palning and impact evaluation across different government levels and domains.
  The challengers of PPAI4SDG will make use the latest development of PPI–an online application with a graphical interface–to produce policy advise regarding the
  policy prioritisation strategies.
  Visit PPI's official page to learn more about its scientific outputs, policy applications, and analytic tools."
